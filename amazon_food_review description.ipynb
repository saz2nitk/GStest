    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an Amazon data scientist and have been asked to find out insights from the 'Amazon Fine Foods Review' data. Your aim is to do text classification using Deep Learning on the reviews. This dataset has various features but for this project you will only need the `reviews(text)` as training data. This is a supervised Learning task so you will use `Score` as the label, while training. You have to make a classification model which will rate the review at a scale from 1 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon. The data span a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories. The original data contains `568,454` reviews collected from `256,059` users on `74,258` products. \n",

    "They have been divided into a zip file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A zipped file containing the following items is given:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `train.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "The data file `train.csv` contains the `40500` instances with the `3` features including the target feature\n",
    "\n",
    "- `test.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "The datafile `test.csv` contains the `1000`instances with the `2` feature excluding the target feature.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the model on `train.csv` data, the learner has to predict the target feature of the `test.csv` data using the trained model. The learner has to then submit a csv file with the predicted feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample submission file(`sample_submission.csv`) is given to you as a reference to the format expected when you submit \n",
    "\n",

    "## Evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular dataset we are using simple `F1 Score`(weighted) as the evaluation metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions will be evaluated based on [F1 score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html) as  per the below threshold.\n",

    "|Your `F1 score` score| Points earned for the Task|\n",

    "|`F1 score`>= 0.63|100% of the available points|\n",
    "| 0.63 > `F1 score` >= 0.60 |80% of the available points|\n",
    "| 0.60 > `F1 score` >= 0.55 |70% of the available points|\n",
    "|`F1 score` < 0.55|No points earned|\n",

    "### Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this project you will understand the basic pipeline of sentiment classification using Deep Learning. In this project you will apply the following concepts:\n",

    "- Word Embeddings using GloVe\n",
    "- LSTM using keras\n",
